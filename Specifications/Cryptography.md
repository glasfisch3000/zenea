# Cryptographic Standards
Zenea uses the Ed25519 Elliptic Curve Signature method to sign and verify entries. Each author is an asymmetric key pair of that algorithm where the private key is used to create signatures and the public key is used to verify them and as author identification.
Each cryptographic key has a size of 32 bytes or 256 bits.
Each signature has a size of 64 bytes or 512 bits.

# Zenea
The Zenea Project is a new approach to file storage and sharing. It aims to establish a simple yet versatile protocol for organising and structuring data that can be used as a basis for a wide variety of data handling and storage systems. On top of that, it builds on the concept of distributed cloud storage and file exchange to create a decentralised network-based system for sharing and synchronising data.
